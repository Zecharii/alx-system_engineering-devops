# Networking basics 1
This project was done as part of the **Software Engineering** at **ALX**. It was aimed at teaching us about localhost/127.0.0.1, what is 0.0.0.0, what is `/etc/hosts` and how to display the machine's active network interfaces.

## Technologies
* All scripts were written in python3 (version 3.4.3)
* The console was developed in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
