# Postmortem: Outage Incident - Service Unavailability

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** January 15, 2023, 9:00 AM PST to January 15, 2023, 11:30 AM PST
- **Impact:** The outage affected the web application's login functionality, rendering it unavailable for all users attempting to log in during the incident period. Approximately 30% of users were unable to access the service.
- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by an unexpected surge in traffic due to a marketing campaign launched by the company. This led to a bottleneck in the authentication service, resulting in degraded performance and eventual service unavailability.

## Timeline

- **9:00 AM PST:** The issue was initially detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server response times.
- **9:10 AM PST:** Engineers began investigating the issue, suspecting a potential database overload or network latency.
- **9:30 AM PST:** After analyzing server logs, it was determined that the authentication service was experiencing a high volume of requests, causing performance degradation.
- **10:00 AM PST:** Misleading investigation paths were taken, including exploring database performance and network connectivity issues.
- **10:30 AM PST:** The incident was escalated to the DevOps team and senior engineers for further investigation and resolution.
- **11:00 AM PST:** Through extensive analysis of server metrics and traffic patterns, it was identified that the surge in traffic was caused by a marketing campaign.
- **11:30 AM PST:** The issue was resolved by implementing temporary rate limiting on incoming authentication requests to alleviate the load on the authentication service.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the issue was determined to be an unexpected surge in traffic generated by a marketing campaign, resulting in a bottleneck in the authentication service.
- **Resolution:** To mitigate the issue, temporary rate limiting was implemented on incoming authentication requests to reduce the load on the authentication service. Additionally, capacity planning measures were initiated to ensure the system could handle future traffic spikes effectively.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:** 
  - Implement automated scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic patterns.
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide early detection of traffic surges and performance degradation.
  - Conduct regular load testing and capacity planning exercises to identify and address potential bottlenecks before they impact production environments.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Update infrastructure provisioning scripts to automate the deployment of additional resources during traffic spikes.
  - Implement caching mechanisms to alleviate the load on backend services and improve overall system performance.
  - Conduct a post-incident review to document lessons learned and update incident response procedures accordingly.
