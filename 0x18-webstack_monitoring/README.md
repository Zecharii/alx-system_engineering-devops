# Webstack monitoring 
This project was done as part of the requirements for the **Software Engineering** program at **ALX**. It aims to teach us about debugging of web stacks.

## Learning Objectives
Learning how to:
* Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
* Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)

## Technologies
* All files were interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 
* All Bash scripts passed the `Shellcheck` (version `0.3.7`) styling without any error
* All Bash scripts/files are executable
