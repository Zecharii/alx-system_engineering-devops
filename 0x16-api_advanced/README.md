# API Advanced 
This project was done as part of the requirements for the **Software Engineering** program at **ALX**. It aims to teach us about advanced APIs and how they help to query requests.

## Learning Objectives
* How to read API documentation to find the endpoints youâ€™re looking for
* How to use an API with pagination
* How to parse JSON results from an API

* How to sort a dictionary by value

## Technologies
* All files were interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version `3.4.3`)

* All Pythin scripts/files are executable
